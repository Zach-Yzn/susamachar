## It Points to God’s Glory

No door that God opens will ever contradict Scripture. For example, a man who thought he was supposed to divorce his Christian wife in order to spend the rest of his life in mission work overseas is not from God and not supported by Scripture. This man could easily go and do missionary work overseas and not have to divorce his wife, or he could see if she wanted to go with him. Instead, he got an unbiblical divorce, so how is supposed to witness for Christ when he is contradicting the Bible and disobeying Jesus’ command to not divorce except for sexual immorality? Clearly, that is not God’s will because loving God means obeying His commandments (2 John 1:6). If someone says they know Him but doesn’t keep His commandments, he is not of God (1 John 2:3), and God calls him or her a liar (1 John 2:4). Obedience to God glorifies Him.

## Confirmation From Others

Jesus is the one “who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens” and sets before us “an open door, which no one is able to shut” (Revelation 3:8-9). If the door won’t open for you, then that door may not be the one God wants you to walk through. Jimmying the lock or trying to break the door down won’t work.  Just pray for God to reveal to you which door you are to walk through and make it obvious to you so you’ll know for sure.



## **The Door Makes You Utterly Dependent on Him**

If you can manage to go through a door and not need God’s help for anything, then you might be walking through a door in your own flesh and depending on the strength.  If you’re not depending on God to open a door, then you are depending on your own self.  That’s a bad plan, and I ought to know; I’ve done it!  God wants us to be totally dependent upon Him because any work we do is for Him anyway and for His glory. Jesus said we can’t do anything without Him (John 15:5).  We can’t even produce any fruit without Him, unless it’s wax fruit  (John 15:4).
